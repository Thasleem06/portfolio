## Personal portfolio website
              This repository contains the source code and files for my personal portfolio website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
               A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. It's one of the most practical and memorable ways to share your work with press, potential collaborators or employers. Much like your PDF portfolio, a portfolio website can be used when applying for jobs or internships

## Lessons Learned
               Building a personal portfolio website can be a great learning experience
>>Before you start coding, it’s important to know what you want your portfolio to achieve. 
>>Define your goals early to prevent wasting time on features that may not add value.
>>Not everyone will view your portfolio on a desktop. Ensuring that your site looks good on mobile devices and tablets is critical.... Learn and implement responsive web design principles.
>>You might learn a lot of new skills, from web design (HTML, CSS) to front-end frameworks
>>The web is constantly evolving with new technologies, design trends, and best practices. Building a portfolio is an ongoing project—you'll want to update it regularly to reflect your growing skills.
>>Accessibility should be a priority. Not all users will have the same experience on your site.
